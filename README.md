# Runner-AI
Train an AI to master Pixel Runner using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with PyTorch and Pygame. This project implements a neural network that learns jump timing through reinforcement learning, featuring normalized state inputs, gravity tracking, and optimized reward functions for high performance.
